###### postdoctoral researcher | CoNE lab., Hanyang University, South Korea
<br>
<br>
Hi. I was born in Seoul, South Korea, in 1989. I received the B.S. degree from [the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yonsei University](https://bme.yonsei.ac.kr/new_page/){:target="\_blank"}, South Korea, in 2013, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from [the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University](http://ee.hanyang.ac.kr/index.php){:target="\_blank"}, South Korea, in 2015 and 2020, respectively. I am currently working as a [postdoctoral researcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher){:target="\_blank"} at [Computational NeuroEngineering (CoNE) Laboratory](http://cone.hanyang.ac.kr/){:target="\_blank"} in [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/){:target="\_blank"}.

I major in [computational neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience){:target="\_blank"}. I am skilled in acquiring/analyzing bioelectric signals such as [electroencephalogram (EEG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography){:target="\_blank"}, [electromyogram (EMG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography){:target="\_blank"}, and [electrooculogram (EOG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrooculography){:target="\_blank"}. I have a good knowledge of [(real-time) signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing){:target="\_blank"} and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning){:target="\_blank"}/[deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning){:target="\_blank"} and can apply them to bioelectric signals using [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html){:target="\_blank"} and [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="\_blank"}. 

I have published [10 papers in SCI journals]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}){:target="\_blank"} and 1 paper in non-SCI journals. Fourteen papers were presented at the international conferences and eleven at the domestic conferences. I had 11 patents filled/issued in the S. Korea and USA. Please check all my achievements by watching my [cv](/assets/cv/CV.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.

During my career, I have won six awards, including: 
- Best Paper Award @ 55th Korean Society of Medical Biological Engineering [[click]](/assets/awards/06.jpg){:target="_blank"}
- Best Poster Paper Award @ 54th Korean Society of Medical Biological Engineering [[click]](/assets/awards/05.jpg){:target="_blank"}
- Young Investigator Award @ SMIT2018-IBEC2018 Joint Conference [[click]](/assets/awards/04.jpg){:target="_blank"}
- Young Investigator Travel Award @ SMIT2018-IBEC2018 Joint Conference [[click]](/assets/awards/03.jpg){:target="_blank"}
- Best Poster Award @ International Biomedical Engineering Conference [[click]](/assets/awards/02.jpg){:target="_blank"}
- Excellence Poster Paper Award @ 50th Korean Society of Medical Biological Engineering [[click]](/assets/awards/01.jpg){:target="_blank"}

My research topics include: 
- [brain-computer interfaces (BCI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface){:target="_blank"} / brain-machine interfaces (BMI)
- [passive BCI](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6579/aad57e){:target="_blank"} for brain status monitoring and wearable neurointerface
- biosignal-based [human-computer interaction/interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction){:target="_blank"} in VR environments

I have developed various real-time neurointerfaces:
- silent speech recognition system based on EMG (will be released after publication)
- facial expression regression based on EMG (will be released after publication)
- facial expression recognition system based on EMG [[video link]](https://youtu.be/KLhR6EVkGOM){:target="_blank"}
- lip shape recognition system based on EMG [[video link]](https://youtu.be/4DtvWsn1aA8){:target="_blank"}
- Triple blink detection system based on EOG [[video link]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nMDxb8t0uoMGfen8n8AQLEH80OPDl0n9/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
